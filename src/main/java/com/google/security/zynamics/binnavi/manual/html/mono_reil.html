		<h2>The MonoREIL static code analysis framework</h2>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>To make it as easy as possible to write new static analysis 
		algorithms based on REIL, BinNavi comes with a static code analysis 
		framework called MonoREIL. This framework is exposed to the plugin API 
		and can therefore be used from scripts and plugins that need to do their 
		own static code analysis.</p>
		<h3><span lang="de">General Concepts<img alt="state propagation" height="420" src="../images/state_propagation_description.png" style="float: right" width="159" /></span></h3>
		<p><span lang="de">Static analysis works, very simplified, by defining 
		state and using transforms on a state to generate a new state. A state 
		can be anything from a set of registers to a complex memory abstraction. 
		A transform can be anything from REIL instruction specific register 
		transforms to fine grained memory shape analysis. In BinNavi static 
		analysis is aimed at helping you to get your job done a little faster 
		and giving you the oversight needed in complex situations.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">BinNavi provides static analysis on graphs which 
		consist of edges and nodes. A graph here means directed graph. BinNavi 
		keeps state in edges which means that a state is associated with an 
		edge. Transforms are performed in a node and on a state which means that 
		a transformation is defined to take a state as input and have a state as 
		output. Such that for example:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li><span lang="de">state 2 = transformation2(state 1) when 
			traversal is done downwards. </span></li>
			<li><span lang="de">state 1 = transformation2(state 2) when 
			traversal is done upwards.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p><span lang="de">Storing state in edges has a side effect which is 
		important to note. Given you want to analyze the effects of the first 
		node in a graph there is no edge where the incoming state can be 
		associated to. This also holds true for the effect of the exit nodes in 
		a graph as there are no edges to store the associated state. To be able 
		to perform an analysis over the complete graph and still have edges 
		where state can be associated with, artificial start and end nodes are 
		inserted into the graph. These nodes serve as single entry / exit nodes. 
		Such that the start node is connected to all possible entries into a 
		graph and all possible exits from the graph are connected to the end 
		node. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">As we have seen the general concept of static 
		analysis as used in BinNavi is keep it simple stupid. We will now take a 
		look how we are actually transforming a native graph into a graph that 
		can be used by the current analysis means that we provide. Native here 
		means architecture native such as x86 or ARM for example.</span></p>
		<h3><span lang="de">Building Analyzable Graphs</span></h3>
		<p>F<span lang="de">or any analysis in MonoREIL, the analysis needs a 
		graph to operate on. To
		<img class="style3" height="285" src="../images/initial_graph.png" style="float: left" width="234" />explain 
		the concepts assume that we want to analyze the flow graph of a 
		function. For the analysis to work we need a graph as input to our 
		static analysis which it is able to work with. The type of graph that it 
		can currently analyze are REIL instruction graphs. Therefore we will now 
		describe what process is done to transform a native flow graph into a 
		REIL instruction graph.</span></p>
		<p>O<span lang="de">ur example graph on the left has seven basic blocks 
		containing native instructions. The first step of the transformation is 
		to generate a REIL graph from the flow graph. What happens is that for 
		each native instruction a REIL translation will be performed. This 
		yields one to many REIL instructions per native instruction. These REIL 
		instructions are also organized in basic blocks.</span></p>
		<p>
		<img class="style4" height="645" src="../images/initial_graph_and_REIL.png" style="float: right" width="680" /></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="de">Each 
		REIL basic block consists of one or multiple REIL instructions. As you 
		can see in the graph above, some of the native basic blocks are 
		represented by multiple REIL basic blocks and some are represented by single REIL basic 
		blocks. Furthermore the REIL graph has multiple edges per native 
		instruction, which will be important later when we want to map states to 
		native instruction edges. </span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="de">
		<img height="525" src="../images/REIL_to_instruction_graph.png" style="float: left" width="466" />The 
		next step of transformation is from the REIL graph to the REIL 
		instruction graph which is the input to the solver. This transformation 
		splits all REIL basic blocks after each REIL instruction and inserts 
		edges in between them. </span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="de">In the graph on the left there is a schematic 
		representation of how this would look for the first REIL basic block in 
		the graph.</span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="de">We have now converted a native flow graph all the way to 
		a REIL instruction graph as input for the MonoREIL solver. Also we have 
		observed that due to the fine grained nature of the REIL graph and even 
		more the REIL instruction graph there are many more edges in the graph 
		then in the original flow graph. </span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="de">We remember that in our general concepts section above 
		we described briefly how we save state in edges and transforms are 
		performed on nodes. The REIL instruction graph provides us with exact 
		the right structure to do this now. As we have nodes where each node 
		only contains a single REIL instruction which we have to specify a 
		transformation for, and after each node we can save the state resulting 
		from transformation in the edges leading either to or from the node.
		</span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="de">After we have now covered the general concepts of the 
		MonoREIL framework in BinNavi and discussed what type of graphs we are 
		able to work with, we will now dive into a description of the various 
		components of MonoREIL. </span></p>
		<h3>The components of MonoREIL</h3>
		<h4>Mono<span lang="de">REIL</span> Solver</h4>
		<p>The <span lang="de">M</span>ono<span lang="de">REIL</span> solver is the class which executes code analysis 
		algorithms. To execute an analysis algorithm, the algorithm needs to be 
		aware of a few concepts and implement a few classes. These are described 
		below.</p>
		<p><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4><span lang="de">MonoReil Solver Result</span></h4>
		<p><span lang="de">The MonoReil solver result is the result produced by 
		the MonoREIL solver after the execution of an analysis algorithm. It 
		provides access to all states stored in lattice elements.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4>Lattice Graph<span lang="de">s</span></h4>
		<p>All MonoREIL-based algorithms work on so called lattice graphs, 
		directed graphs which are generated from the <span lang="de">disassembly</span>.<span lang="de"> 
		These graphs build the foundation for the analysis, are inputs for the 
		MonoREIL solver. </span>Right 
		now only one type of lattice graph, the instruction graph, is supported. Instruction graphs are directed graphs whose nodes 
		contain exactly one REIL instruction and whose directed edges specify 
		the potential control flow between the instructions in the nodes.<span lang="de">
		</span></p>
		<p class="style5"><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4><span lang="de">Lattice</span></h4>
		<p><span lang="de">A lattice in MonoREIL provides the container for 
		lattice elements. The requirements for a lattice are small. The first 
		requirement is that it defines how two multiple lattice elements can be 
		combined into a single lattice element XXX EXAMPLE XXX. The second one 
		is that it defines a minimal element for the specified lattice XXX 
		EXAMPLE XXX. The third is that it provides a &quot;&lt;=&quot; is smaller equal 
		method for the lattice elements. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4>Lattice Element</h4>
		<p>&nbsp;Lattice elements can be arbitrary objects and the lattice itself is parameterized by a
		lattice element type. The only requirement for lattice elements is that MonoREIL must
		be able to determine whether a fix point has been reached. To do this, MonoREIL performs
		a less than or equal comparison for lattice elements while propagating data flow values across the graph.
		As soon as MonoREIL determines that there is no global improvement with regards to the precision of the data flow values,
		the iteration stops and the result vector is returned.</p>
		<p><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4><span lang="de">Defining Initial State</span></h4>
		<p>MonoREIL works by <span lang="de">traversing</span> the lattice graph 
		and propagating analysis results from <span lang="de">edge</span> to
		<span lang="de">edge</span> <span lang="de">through the transformation 
		specified by the nodes</span> of the graph. When 
		the code analysis algorithm starts <span lang="de">the algorithms needs 
		a ground truth to start working on. We can name this the initial state 
		of the analysis. Generally this initial state can be thought as a kind 
		of seed to the analysis for example in register taint tracking the 
		register to be tracked would be in the initial state. Another</span> example 
		i<span lang="de">s</span> an algorithm <span lang="de">that </span>tracks the potential values of registers and it is known 
		beforehand that the register <span class="style1">r0</span> always has 
		the value <span class="style1">0x78110</span> at instruction
		<span class="style1">0x1002552</span> <span lang="de">then </span>the initial state should 
		reflect this fact.</p>
		<p><span lang="de">The initial state is only special in the sense that 
		it is the first non empty state at analysis start. Other then that it is 
		also saved in a lattice element like every other state as well. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4>Graph <span lang="de">Traversal</span></h4>
		<p>Different analysis algorithms require MonoREIL to take different 
		paths through the lattice graph. <span lang="de">Per default currently 
		there are two different ways to traverse the graph downwards which is 
		equivalent to the native execution order and upwards which is reverse 
		execution order.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">XXX LINK TO THE API XXX</span></p>
		<h4>Transformation Provider</h4>
		<p>While <span lang="de">traversing</span> the lattice graph, new information about the 
		analysis state of the visited <span lang="de">edges</span> must be discovered. This is the role 
		of transformation providers which define how lattice graph nodes
		<span lang="de">transform incoming state into outgoing state depending 
		on analysis graph traversal direction.</span></p>
		<p>The transformation provider is the core part of each code analysis 
		algorithm. Depending on the type of the lattice graph and the complexity 
		of the code analysis algorithm a transformation provider can be 
		<span lang="de">anywhere </span>between 
		ten lines and several thousands lines long.</p>
		<p>When using the default instruction graph, the transformation provider 
		of an analysis algorithm defines how each instruction influences the 
		tracked information. Assume the implementation of a code analysis 
		algorithm that tracks register values and encounters the REIL 
		instruction <span class="style1">add r0, 8, r0</span>. Knowing that 
		before the execution of this instruction the value of register
		<span class="style1">r0</span> is <span class="style1">n</span> the 
		transformation provider would update the state of the lattice graph node 
		that represents that instruction to contain the information that the 
		value of <span class="style1">r0</span> is <span class="style1">n+8</span> 
		after the instruction is executed.</p>
		<h4><span lang="de">Remarks on </span>Lattice<span lang="de">s</span></h4>
		<p>In nearly all cases lattice graphs do not take the form of linked 
		lists. Branches in the input REIL code cause branches in the lattice 
		graph. Whenever two paths of the lattice graph end in the same node, 
		information from both paths is <span lang="de">transformed</span>
		<span lang="de">by</span> the node<span lang="de"> into the outgoing 
		edges</span>. Since there is no ge<span lang="de">neric approach</span> 
		how to combine information from <span lang="de">a set of</span> analysis 
		<span lang="de">states</span>, it is necessary that all code analysis algorithms implement a so 
		called lattice object that defines how to merge information from 
		converging lattice graph paths.</p>
		<h3>How do<span lang="de"> I</span> <span lang="de">make </span>MonoREIL work<span lang="de"> 
		for me</span>?</h3>
		<p><span lang="de">First of all we have to make sure that all of the 
		above components have been implemented according to our desired 
		analysis. These parts are in short:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li><span lang="de">A lattice that provides:</span><ul>
				<li><span lang="de">A combine function for lattice elements.</span></li>
				<li><span lang="de">A minimal lattice element.</span></li>
				<li><span lang="de">A function to compare lattice elements.</span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span lang="de">A lattice element that describes:</span><ul>
				<li><span lang="de">A state for the desired analysis.</span></li>
				<li><span lang="de">A function that defines what will happen on 
				a native instruction exit edge.</span></li>
				<li><span lang="de">Functions that provide update mechanisms for 
				the state description.</span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span lang="de">A transformation provider for the lattice graph 
			that describes:</span><ul>
				<li><span lang="de">For each possible transform a transformation 
				from an incoming state to an outgoing state.</span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once all components described above are defined for a static code 
		analysis algorithm, the solve function of the Mono<span lang="de">ReilSolver 
		class can be called</span>. This function takes <span lang="de">all</span> defined 
		<span lang="de">initial state and traverses</span> through the lattice graph according to the 
		<span lang="de">analysis direction </span>defined. On visiting a node, the transformation provider 
		discovers analysis <span lang="de">states</span> for <span lang="de">all 
		edges of </span>the node<span lang="de">, incoming for downwards 
		analysis and outgoing for upwards traversal</span>. This information is 
		<span lang="de">transformed</span> <span lang="de">in</span> 
		the nodes <span lang="de">to outgoing states which are saved to all 
		edges of the node, incoming for upwards traversal and outgoing for 
		downwards traversal. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="de">To get all information that is contained in the graph 
		according to our desired analysis we need to make sure that we propagate 
		the collected information. This is done with the comparison operation 
		that we have described in our lattice. For each state associated to an 
		edge we compare the state associated to the edge prior to the analysis 
		with our results from the state which resulted from the transformation, 
		given the new state has more information we include the node connected 
		to the edge into our traversal. This behavior makes sure that we collect 
		all the information according to our analysis from the graph.</span>This process continues 
		until MonoREIL notices that the analysis algorithm can not find any more 
		information. The final analysis state of all nodes is returned as the 
		result of the analysis algorithm<span lang="de"> in an object that we 
		call MonoReilSolverResult</span>.</p>
		<p>Since information is propagated between <span lang="de">edges</span> until no more 
		information can be generated by the analysis algorithm it is vitally 
		important that information is never lost. If a transformation provider 
		or a lattice ever removes information from the current analysis state, 
		the termination of the Solver can not be guaranteed and the 
		code analysis algorithm might get stuck in an endless loop.</p>
		<h3><span lang="de">Graphic representation of analysis results in 
		BinNavi</span></h3>
		<p><span lang="de">For an analysis to be useful to you and to have the 
		option to show your superiors pretty pictures about what you have been 
		doing the last couple of days it is necessary to display the results of 
		the analysis in the graphic user interface of BinNavi. As all of the 
		analysis results get stored in REIL instruction graph edges which are 
		not displayable by BinNavi currently, we provide a function which maps 
		the analysis results of a single native instruction represented as a 
		part of the REIL instruction graph back to the original native 
		instruction for example in the flow graph of a function. The results of 
		this convenience function can then be used to display analysis results 
		in the graphic user interface.</span></p>

		code analysis algorithm in the <span class="style1">scripts/mono/sample</span>
