This directory is always added to the Python scripting path,
so you can place files you want to import in the Python
scripting console here.

For example, if you place analysis.py here you can simply
do

> import analysis

in the Python console of the scripting dialog.

Furthermore it is possible to place files here which are automatically
executed when a new scripting console is opened. These files are have
the name "init" followed by the typical file extension for the
individual languages (init.py, init.rb. init.js, ...).
